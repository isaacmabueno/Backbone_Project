**SUMMARY:** A full stack application in Sinatra using Backbone.js.
This is the readme.md file for LD-EVERYDAY. A fun source for getting randomly generated Larry David quotes. The purpose of this application is to simply display an example of rending data through a RESTful API that I built. The RESTful API was built from data I collected from IMDB.
**PURPOSE:** The purpose of this website is to use Backbone.js to render data through the RESTful API.
**HOW THE WEBSITE WORKS:** The website is simple in its functionality. Every time you click Larry's name tag he spits out a new quote.

* HTML
